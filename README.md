# dsa_project
"Habib Maps" was a project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course in my freshman year of university. Having no prior experience in coding before university, my partner and I decided to create a project that was simple yet effective and filled with learning.
We opted to use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point instead of Dijkstra as we were taught the latter during the semester hence we opted to use an algorithm that required self-learning on our part. Another reason to opt for A* was that it tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra explores all possible ways. Hence, we preferred A* algorithm's informed search approach.
