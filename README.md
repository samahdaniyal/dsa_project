# dsa_project
"Habib Maps" was a project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course in my freshman year of university. Having no prior experience in coding before university, my partner and I decided to create a project that was simple yet effective and filled with learning.
We made a map of Habibâ€™s Lower Ground floor, for the back-end we used Graph data structure and the A* algorithm and for the front-end (map display) we used a path shown by Python's turtle module and a dictionary used to store turtle coordinates mapped onto corresponding areas.
We opted to use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point instead of Dijkstra as we were taught the latter during the semester hence we opted to use an algorithm that required self-learning on our part. Another reason to opt for A* was that it tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra explores all possible ways. Hence, we preferred A* algorithm's informed search approach. 
We need the Euclidean Distance equation as our heuristic function to calculate the estimated steps that would be required to reach our end node from the node we are standing on. In our code, we have made a dictionary with keys being the nodes and their coordinates being the values.
The time complexity of our code is O(n^3). (big-Oh of n^3)
